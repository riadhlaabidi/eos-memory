\chapter{Release 1: Users, segmentation \& channels}

\phantomsection
\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter, we focus on the first release of our product, this release aims to create and enhance
the user experience, implement userbase segmentation strategies, and manage notification channels.
We will delve into the sprints backlog, design considerations, and the implementation process
undertaken to bring these features to fruition.

\section{Sprints backlog}
During the Sprint Planning event, we estimated the effort required for each item in the sprint backlog
based on the number of working hours.

The priority of backlog items is reflected by their relative order in the table. Items positioned
higher in the table indicate a higher priority. \\

\section{Design}
The design phase of software development is a critical step in the software development life cycle.
It is the process of transforming the customer requirements into a detailed plan for how the software
will be implemented. In this section we are going to focus on the design aspects related to the database
and sodtware design.

\subsection{Database design}
The figure \ref{g-erd}  illustrates the entity-relationship diagram for our first release.

    \caption{Notification Center entity-relationship diagram}
    \label{g-erd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Software design}

\subsubsection{Class diagram}
The class diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's structure, relationships,
and interactions between different classes. It represents the static structure of the system,
including classes, attributes, methods, and associations.

The figure \ref{g-class} illustrates the class diagram for our first release.

    \label{g-class}
\end{figure}

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Authentication page}
The figure \ref{ss-signin} illustrates the final result of the implementation of the authentication epic.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/signin}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Agents management page}
The figure \ref{ss-agents} illustrates the final result of the implementation of the agents management epic.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/agents}
    \caption{Agents management page}
    \label{ss-agents}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Channels management page}
The figure \ref{ss-channels} illustrates the final result of the implementation of the channels management epic.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/channels}
    \caption{Channels management page}
    \label{ss-channels}
