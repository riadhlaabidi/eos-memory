\chapter{Release 1: Users, segmentation \& channels}

\phantomsection
\section*{Introduction}
In this chapter, we focus on the first release of our product, this release aims to create and enhance
the user experience, implement userbase segmentation strategies, and manage notification channels.
We will delve into the sprints backlog, design considerations, and the implementation process
undertaken to bring these features to fruition.

\section{Sprints backlog}
During the Sprint Planning event, we estimated the effort required for each item in the first and second
sprints backlog based on the number of working hours.

The priority of backlog items is reflected by their relative order in the table. Items positioned
higher in the table indicate a higher priority. \\

\section{Specification}
In this section we are going to provide a detailed breakdown of some user stories. Each user story will
be presented in a structured table format, ensuring ease of reference for the development
team and that each user story is comprehensively documented. This table will include four key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Precondition:} Highlights any necessary conditions or prerequisites that must be
          in place before the user story can be initiated.
    \item \textbf{Business rules:} Business rules are critical as they define the constraints, policies,
          and conditions that govern how the software should behave in response to user interactions.
    \item \textbf{Technical specification:} This part specifies the technical aspects of the user story.
          It outlines the specific technical requirements, technologies, and architecture considerations that
          will be essential for the development team to realize the user story.
    \item \textbf{Acceptance criteria:} This section will provide a clear list of conditions that must
          be met for the user story to be considered complete and ready for release.

\section{Design}
The design phase of software development is a critical step in the software development life cycle.
It is the process of transforming the customer requirements into a detailed plan for how the software
will be implemented. In this section we are going to focus on the design aspects related to the software
and database design.

\subsection{Class diagram}
The class diagram provides a high-level overview of the system's structure, relationships,
and interactions between different classes. It represents the static structure of the system,
including classes, attributes, methods, and associations.

\noindent The following table provides a description of each class being part of the first release design.

\subsection{Database design}
In this section, We will discuss the structure and organization of our database, defining tables and relationships
between entities for efficient data management within our solution.

\subsubsection{Data dictionary}

First, we will define a data dictionary that describes the fields associated with each data element,
indicating their types and constraints as shown in the table \ref{tab-r1dd}.

\subsubsection{Logical data model}
A logical data model is a model that is not specific to a database that describes things about which
an organization wants to collect data, and the relationships among these things \cite{ldm}. It contains representations
of entities and attributes, relationships, unique identifiers, and constraints between relationships.  The goal
of creating a logical data model is to develop a highly technical map of underlying rules and data structures.

\noindent The figure \ref{r1-erd}  illustrates the entity-relationship diagram for our first release. \\

\subsection{Sequence diagrams}
In this section, we delve into the dynamic aspects of our software solution by employing \acrshort{uml}
sequence diagrams. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the interactions and communication
patterns among various components and actors within our system. As we explore these sequences,
we aim to shed light on the flow of information, the order of operations, and the coordination
between different elements in our software architecture.


\subsubsection{Sequence diagram for Creating a channel}
First, we outline the process of creating notification channels, a critical functionality
designed to integrate external notification delivery services within our solution.

As depicted in the user story, only administrators can create and manage channels. After filling the channel
credentials the client validates the input data at the component level and hands the request to
the server. In order to verify channel credentials, our server needs to communicate with external servers (Facebook,
Twilio, Slack, Line). The reponse then tells if the channel is valid and could be saved in the database,
or the credentials are invalid which cancels the request and asks the administrator to verify their input.

\noindent The following figure \ref{seq-create-channel} illustrates the sequence diagram for creating a channel.

\subsubsection{Sequence diagram for creating an audience}
For the user segmentation feature, both administrators and agents have the ability to create segments
based on specific criteria.  This essential functionality enables them to precisely target user subscriptions
with relevant notifications.

In order to create an audience, users (administrators or agents) need to give their new audiences a name,
then they can add one or more selection criteria while specifying for each criteria: a filter, a comparison operator,
and a filtering value. The service layer of the client intercepts the changes while users are adding these criteria
to make audience size estimation requests to the server, updating this information every short interval of time
to keep users informed about the segments they are creating.

\noindent The following figure \ref{seq-create-audience} illustrates the sequence diagram for creating an audience.

\section{Implementation}
In the following section, we embark on a visual journey through a series of captured screenshots to provide
an in-depth glimpse into the user interface and functionality of our application.
the implementation of our application.

\subsection{Authentication}
The figure \ref{ss-signin} showcases the live implementation of the sign-in page, where users can provide
their credentials (email address and password) in order to authenticate. The "Remember Me" checkbox allows
users to stay signed in on future visits without the need to re-enter their credentials. The "Forget your
password?" link provides a way for users to reset their password if they have forgotten it, and if there's
an authentication error, a red banner with the error message is displayed above the input fields. \\

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/signin}
    \caption{Authentication page}
    \label{ss-signin}
\end{figure}


The figure \ref{ss-reset} illustrates the implementation of the reset password page. A user is redirected to
this interface when they click on the "Forgot your password?" link from the previous "Sign In" page,
they should provide their email address and click on the reset button. A banner indicating that an email
to recover their password is sent to their email address shows above the email input field.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/reset}
    \caption{Password reset page}
    \label{ss-reset}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Agents management}
The figure \ref{ss-agents} illustrates the implementation of the agents management page.
The table lists all the users (agents and administrators) for the logged in administrator, showing
an overview of their information. For each user, an administrator can edit, reset a password, or delete
an agent using the action buttons in the most right column, or else they can create a new
agent or administrator using the "Create a new agent" button.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/agents}
    \caption{Agents management page}
    \label{ss-agents}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Channels management}
The figure \ref{ss-channels} illustrates the final result of the implementation of channels management. The table
lists information about created channels for every service provider that can integrate with our solution. The
administrator can edit or delete these channels using the action buttons.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{app/channels}
    \caption{Channels management page}
    \label{ss-channels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Audience management}
The figure \ref{ss-audience} illustrates the final result of the implementation of the audience creation page.
We created some selection criteria: the subsciption channel should be of email type, users age should be greater
than 18 years, and subscribers are located in Tunisia. The size estimation for such audience is displayed in the section above.

\section*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}

In this initial release, we defined user stories and related constraints in the specification phase.
During the design phase we created a detailed plan that outlines how different components will interact to
ensure that the software is well-organized, efficient, and capable of addressing the intended needs and
goals. Finally, we showcased the result of implementing the essential components in our first release.

\noindent In the upcoming chapter, we will focus on the development of our second product release.
