This report outlines the design and implementation of a notification center
as a part of the "Convergence" project, which aims to drive digital transformation
within the insurance and finance sectors while improving client engagement and
optimizing internal processes. The notification center provides a scalable solution
for managing and delivering tailored notifications through various channels,
facilitating timely and personalized interactions. This project was made during an
end-of-studies internship in order to obtain the Master's degree in Software Engineering
at the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Mathematics of Monastir (ISIMM).
